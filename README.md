Demo for assets feature in Next.js app.

Run the app:
```bash
nx serve demo
```

Observe that [http://localhost:4200/assets/test.md](http://localhost:4200/assets/test.md) returns the asset.

> Note: since during dev the assets are copied to the source `public/assets/` folder, it needs to be gitignored.
